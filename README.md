This dataset is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.
The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in the wine and their effects on it's quality. 
The classes are ordered and not balanced i.e. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones.

The complexity arises due to the fact that the dataset has fewer samples, & is highly imbalanced.
This dataframe contains the following columns :

Fixed acidity, Volatile acidity, Citric acid, Residual sugar, Chlorides, Free Sulfur Dioxide, Total Sulfur Dioxide, Density, pH, Sulphates, Alcohol and Quality (score between 0 and 10)
